@Dad can you comment on the layout items below?
Yes …. 
FIRST OF ALL … wow what a lot of work you’ve done! Second of all I’ve decided to dedicate 8 AM to 12 noon every Tuesday morning developing the sections you suggest. As I get new clients, I will book them into my Tuesday 8-12 slot and also my drives to and from work every day. Although I’m not planning to expand my client list till November, I’ll start adding clients as they contact me even now and before November.
